# Homelab Platform

This repository documents and manages my personal homelab platform, built to learn and apply DevOps and SRE practices in a realistic environment.

The platform is intentionally evolved in phases, starting from a single-node Kubernetes cluster and expanding over time to include observability, automation, and reliability patterns.

## Goals
- Learn Kubernetes through real workloads
- Practice infrastructure-as-code and Git-based workflows
- Apply platform engineering and SRE principles incrementally

## Structure
- `docs/` – Architecture decisions and design notes
- `k8s/` – Kubernetes manifests and platform configuration

This is an evolving project.
