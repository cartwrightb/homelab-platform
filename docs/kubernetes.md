# Why K3s?

You are using K3s because:
Single binary
Embedded datastore
Sensible defaults
Easy multi-node expansion
Widely used outside “big cloud”
This is not “cut-down Kubernetes”.
It’s production Kubernetes with guardrails.

# Purpose:

“Why K3s, and how it’s installed”
This is portfolio gold.

## Include:

Why K3s vs kubeadm / microk8s / Docker Desktop
Why single-node first
VM sizing
Install command
Known limitations (for now)
Example bullets (not prose-heavy):
Lightweight distribution with production parity
Simple upgrade and expansion path
Appropriate for constrained hardware
Avoids unnecessary cloud-specific abstractions
